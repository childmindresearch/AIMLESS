This model will be ultimately used as rating scales to assess function in specific dimensions of neuropsychology. \\nEach dimension of functioning should be neutral and applicable to the general population, not only disorders. Extreme presentations of a dimension may be related to a cognitive or psychological disorder. \\nEach dimension should also relate to an evidence-based scientific concept or construct for the field of neuropsychology and child development.\\nEach dimension must have a \"parent\" dimension (unless they are \"root\" dimensions) and zero, one or more \"child\" dimensions, illustrating the notion of sub-components or special cases of dimensions.\\n\\nThe “root” dimensions, or highest level psychological domains, should be the following:\\n    1. Negative Valence Systems: primarily responsible for responses to aversive situations or context, such as fear, anxiety, and loss.\\n    2. Positive Valence Systems: primarily responsible for responses to positive motivational situations or contexts, such as reward seeking, consummatory behavior, and reward/habit learning.\\n    3. Cognitive Systems: responsible for various cognitive processes.\\n    4. Systems for Social Processes: mediate responses in interpersonal settings of various types, including perception and interpretation of others’ actions.\\n    5. Arousal/Regulatory Systems: responsible for generating activation of neural systems as appropriate for various contexts and providing appropriate homeostatic regulation of such systems as energy balance and sleep.\\n    6. Sensorimotor Systems: primarily responsible for the control and execution of motor behaviors, and their refinement during learning and development.\\n\\nInclude the following attributes for each dimension:\\n    - \"title\" is the name of the dimension, related to an established concept or construct.\\n    - \"description\" is a brief description of the dimension.\\n    - \"children\" is a list of dimensions, each following the same format, that fall under the umbrella of this higher level category.\\n\\nYour job is to subdivide the dimensions of this tree, one level at a time. I will give you the current hierarchical model, and you add children dimensions as relevant. \\n\\nWe will continue to iterate and split these dimensions until either (a) you determine we have reached the lowest measurable dimensions of neuropsychology, or (b) we complete 10 iterations of this prompt. When creating your subdivisions, keep in mind this is iteration number 1.\\n\\nIf a dimension does not have any relevant subcategories, and represents a single measurable dimension, return it as is, keeping the description identical, and leave the \"children\" attribute empty. Do not add unnecessary dimensions or sublevels.\\n\\nDo not remove or edit any dimension names or descriptions. You are only responsible for adding new dimensions. Do not make the dimensions overly specific, especially on the first and second iterations. Increase the specificity of the dimensions as you add more layers to the model. Only add one additional level to the model at a time.
