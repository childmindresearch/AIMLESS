      "2. Focus Areas: While both cover similar broad categories (Internalizing, Externalizing, Thought Disorder, Detachment, Somatoform), the second taxonomy provides much more elaborate breakdowns of specific symptoms and manifestations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Organization: The first taxonomy (HiTOP) is organized more broadly with three main levels (General Psychopathology, Spectra, and Syndromes/Disorders), while the second provides a more detailed branching structure within each major category.\n",

      "1. General Psychopathology Factor:\n",

      "2. Syndromes/Disorders:\n",
      "- The first taxonomy has a specific category for syndromes/disorders as a distinct level, while the second taxonomy integrates disorders within their respective domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Symptom Components and Traits:\n",
      "- While the second taxonomy includes symptoms, it doesn't have a separate categorical level for personality traits as the HiTOP model does.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Fear vs. Anxiety:\n",
      "- The first taxonomy makes a distinct separation between \"Fear\" and \"Distress\" within the Internalizing spectrum, while the second taxonomy subsumes these under broader anxiety categories.\n",

      "5. Somatoform disorders (with specific manifestations and symptom patterns)\n",
      "\n",
